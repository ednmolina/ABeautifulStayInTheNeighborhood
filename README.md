# Be Our Guest
When booking a place to stay users typically know what part of town they want to stay. Choosing the right Airbnb can come down to a few key features not yet captured in the Airbnb listing such as neighborhood activity (like noise in the area) and price fluctuation over the past 30 days. Be Our Guest enables users to view common 311 complaints

## Datasets
The two datasets used in this projects come from Airbnb and NYC Open Data. There are five years of listing, review, and pricing data available from Airbnb. The [NYC Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) totals to around 60+ GB. The [311 complaints dataset](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9) contains complaints from 2010 to the present. This data amounts to around 13 GB.

For this project the data was gathered early September 2020 so only listing information up until August 2020 can be used. This is because Airbnb releases listing, review, and pricing data at the end of each month.
